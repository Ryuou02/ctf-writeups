Voice Changer `L
at first, it looks like we can inject php code for pitch and in the file, since they both get loaded in the output. however, that doesn't work.

so shell code is directly written in the pitch field like $(ls)
this returns a bunch of files, which means the code is getting executed. 
hence the flag is found to be in the directory /secret.txt
on doing $(cat /secret.txt)
we get the flag

this challenge basically would normally trick the player into trying to change the JWT token to the correct value, however, this is a vulnerability from parseInt() function.
where if you do parseInt("10 20"), it returns 10. hence you can hide integers.

from the source code, we can see that certain characters fail the regex check and give a message, you can view all the characters that get filtered using the website -
https://regexr.com/
everything except newline character tends to fail the regex check.
However, everything after a newline character tends to pass the regex check.
hence, we can get the flag by the ssti payload, after a newline character - 
__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls -al').read()

then

__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat flag.txt').read()

after a newline character to get the flag
