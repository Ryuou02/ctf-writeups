the first thing I do when I open the source code is to open the Docker file of the challenge for possible hints like if the flag is in a text file and where it is, within the server in case it is a text file. However, there seems to be nothing there.
however in the Docker file we see
<code>
CMD ["node", "/app/src/app.js"]
</code>
this indicates that it is a node application with app.js a startpoint. This is quite obvious by looking at the files but still, this is another way to tell the backend of the server.
on opening the countries.yaml file, in the first few lines, we see

<code>
  
  %YAML 1.1
